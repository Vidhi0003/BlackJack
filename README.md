This is an app created for playing BlackJack against a computer. This utilizes JavaFX for the front end and Java for the back end. This is how it is played:

### How the game works:
At the start of the game, two cards are dealt to each player. Both of the user cards will be visible to the user but the first dealer card will be hidden from the user. When given two cards, their values are added. Face cards are worth 10 and Aces are worth either 1 or 11, depending on what is most helpful to the player. Once seeing the two cards, the user has an option to stay on their value or to ”hit” and receive another card. The user may continue to ”hit” until the user decides to stay or their numerical value becomes 22 or greater. This is called a ”bust” and the user loses the hand regardless of the dealer’s action. Once the user has decided to stay, it becomes the dealer’s turn. The dealer must ”hit” on all hands 16 and lower and must stay on all hands 17 and higher. At the end, whoever’s hand is higher wins. If both players have the same value hand, it is a draw and the hand is over without any money changing hands. Finally, if the player hits 21 on two cards by having an Ace and a card with value 10, then that player has ”blackjack” and wins 150% of their winnings unless the dealer also has hit a ”blackjack”, in which case the game is a draw.

### How I planned this game:

To plan this game, I created wireframes for this project. My partner and I both discussed elements of what we wanted to include in the game and I created them using Figma. Here is the prototype:

### The Final Product

Our final product was similar to our prototype. We attempted to create something that was simple and easy to play as some UIs that have a ton of features can distract from the gameplay. These wireframes gave us a guidelines on how we wanted our game to work and we managed to create something that we both were proud of.
